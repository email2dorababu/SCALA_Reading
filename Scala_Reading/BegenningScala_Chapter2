Variables:
----------------------
There are 3 ways you can define variables

VAL - Immutable variable, variable that cannot be changed
VAR - Mutable variable is declared with the keyword var. But you cannot reassign to a different type.
LAZY VAL - these variables are calculated once, the first time the variable is accessed. Only vals can be lazy variables.
We use a Lazy Val if the variable may not be used and the cost of calculating it is very long.

> val x=10   now x is available for use, you cannot change it.
>x*x
res0:Int=100

res0+1
res1: Int = 101
res0+res1
res2: Int = 201
---
var y=10
again if you try to assign different type y=11.5 , gives error, because initial value is of int, but you are trying to assign double value.
y=12 executes without any error.

i.e like other oop languages, convertion to wider type is accepted, but convertion to smaller type gives error.
---------
val x=10e20  - immediately executed.
val y=10e30	-  immediately executed.

lazy val z=x*y   here the value is not calculated immediately.
z:double =<lazy>

var x=10   - immediately executed.

Scala Type Hierarchy:
----------------------
There are no primitive types in Scala. All data types are objects that have methods to operate on their data.
All Scala types - from Numbers to Collections, exists as part of a type hierarchy.
Every "class"  that you define in Scala, belongs to this hierarchy.
Scala's Core types are -

Any - AnyVal, AnyRef
AnyVal - Numeric, Boolean, Char, Unit 
AnyRef - All java.* ref types, All Scala.* ref types. (these all have null type)
AllVal, AllRef have only Nothing Type, (note that there is no null type)
(see the diag in )

Any, AnyVal, and AnyRef Types
----------------------
Class "Any" is the root of scala class hierarchy and it is an abstract class. every class inherits from this class.
AnyVal, AnyRef extend Any type and these 3 are the
