Scala is a functional language. 
Means, 
you can pass functions to methods and functions, and 
return functions from methods and functions.
You can assign functions to variables.

A Function is a block of code that takes parameters and returns a value. 
Functions too must be objects in Scala, because everything is an object in Scala.

e.g function to return square - (i: Int) => {i * i}
Assign function to a variable -   val square =(i: Int) => {i * i}
You can invoke square just like how you call a method. - square(3)

Any variables you created are available for the lifetime of your session.
You can enter into Multi line mode on REPL by :paste  mode, to exit press ctrl+D
To quit the interpreter, type :quit or :q
See each command in :help
