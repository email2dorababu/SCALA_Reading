no useless features of Java, like static members, primitive types, break and continue stmts,enums,or wild cards are just to name a few.

CASE classes are the scala equivalent of Java POJOs.
The essence of Case classes is that they donï¿½t have all the boilerplate code that goes with Java POJOs such as getter and setter methods, equals and hashCode methods, toString method to name a few.
