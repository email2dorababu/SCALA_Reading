Basics of Scala
-----------------------------------------------

Variables:
----------------------
There are 3 ways you can define variables

VAL - Immutable variable, variable that cannot be changed
VAR - Mutable variable is declared with the keyword var. But you cannot reassign to a different type.
LAZY VAL - these variables are calculated once, the first time the variable is accessed. Only vals can be lazy variables.
We use a Lazy Val if the variable may not be used and the cost of calculating it is very long.

> val x=10   now x is available for use, you cannot change it.
>x*x
res0:Int=100

res0+1
res1: Int = 101
res0+res1
res2: Int = 201
---
var y=10
again if you try to assign different type y=11.5 , gives error, because initial value is of int, but you are trying to assign double value.
y=12 executes without any error.

i.e like other oop languages, convertion to wider type is accepted, but convertion to smaller type gives error.
---------
val x=10e20  - immediately executed.
val y=10e30	-  immediately executed.

lazy val z=x*y   here the value is not calculated immediately.
z:double =<lazy>

var x=10   - immediately executed.

Scala Type Hierarchy:
----------------------
Threre are no primitive types in Scala.
