Lightweight Syntax:
-------------------------
no useless features of Java, like static members, primitive types, break and continue stmts,enums,or wild cards are just to name a few.

CASE classes are the scala equivalent of Java POJOs.
The essence of Case classes is that they don�t have all the boilerplate code that goes with Java POJOs such as getter and setter methods, equals and hashCode methods, toString method to name a few.

POJO in scala
case class Book(var title: String, var noOfPages: Int)

Get the java equivalent of Book POJO by
scalac Book.scala  -> this generates Book.class and Book$.class. we then disassemble Book.class with javap command
javap Book -> you cab see all java code is power packed in a single line of scala code.

The javap command is called the Java “disassembler” because it takes apart class files and tells you what’s inside them. 

Multiparadigm Language:
-------------------------
Scala's syntax and type inferencing will reduce the boilerplace code needed when writing programs in Java. 
Boilerplace - is the sections of code that Have to be included in many places with little or no alteration.
used in the context of - programmer must write a lot of code to do minimal job.

Scala has many functional programming facilities, including features found in pure functional language such as Haskell.
http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell

Object-Oriented Language:
-------------------------
Scala is a PURE OOlanguage, i.e it does not include primitive types and sense everything as an object. 
IMP- An Operation between two objects is viewed as an "invocation of a method" on the first operand to "send a message" to the second operand. 
E.g. Numbers are also objects, they have methods. 1+2*3/x is equivalent to (1) .+ (((2).* (3)) ./(x))

Scala does not have static members like Java, becuase static members are not associated with any actual instance.
Instead of static members, Scala provides a singleton object declared using object keyword.

object HelloWorld{
	def greet(){
		println("Hello World!")
		}
	}

You can call HelloWorld.greet()
	
FUnctional Language:
-------------------------
Scala is a functional language. 
Means, 
you can pass functions to methods and functions, and 
return functions from methods and functions.
You can assign functions to variables.

A Function is a block of code that takes parameters and returns a value. 
Functions too must be objects in Scala, because everything is an object in Scala.

E.g. to define a function that returns square of number, simple square function
	(i: Int) => {i * i}  this defines a function that takes an Int parameter and returns a square of the Int value.
	You can assign the function to a variable, this is just like you assign any object to a variable and 
	you can pass the function as an argument to a method, just as you would pass any other object as an arguement to a method. 
 	
 	Assign function to a variable -   val square =(i: Int) => {i * i} , here the variable square is an instance of a function.
 	You can invoke square just like how you call a method. - square(3)
 
 Interoperability and Seamless Integration with Java:
 --------------------------------------------------
Scala can call any Java code, can subclass any java class and implement any java interface.
Scala code, reuses Java libraries and Java types.
Scala allows you to add value to existing java code. Scala designed for seamless interoperability with Java and 
ultimately Scala programs compile to JVM bytecode.

There are some features of scala, that cannot be accessed from Java.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Languages for JVM: 
------------------------
JVM is the runtime environment that provides you the ability to use different programming languages. With Java 8, Java is one of the many 
languages that run on JVM.

JVM languages can be largely classified into two types.
Languages designed for JVM - e.g Clojure, Groovy, Java and Scala
Existing Languages ported to the JVM - e.g JRuby, Jython, and Rhino

Scala source code is intended to be compiled to Java bytecode, so that the resulting executable code runs on a Java virtual machine.
Java libraries may be used directly in Scala code and vice versa.
-----------------------------------------------------------

Installing Scala:
------------------------------
As a JVM language, Scala requires the use of a Java runtime.
Download binaries, and set SCALA_HOME, also set the SCALA_HOME/bin in Path.
Just type scala, gives the scala prompt.

D:\>scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.11.7 (Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM, Java 1.8.0_66).

When you see the above message and scala> prompt, you are in the Scala Interpreter, also called REPL(Read-Eval-Print Loop) and you are ready to start coding.

Scala at CLI, and Scala Scripts:
------------------------------
Scala offers diff(3) ways to run programs, REPL Command line, Single-file Scripts and Compiled Scala programs into class that can be combined into JAR files as in Java.

Interactive Scala:
----------------
The REPL is an excellent tool to learn the Scala language quickly. start REPL by typing scala in command prompt.

HelloWorld program:
scala>
